### Hi there 👋

I am a full stack developer from front-end to back-end, focusing on Ruby on Rails, React, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

I have 3 years of experience working for an enterprise company.

I am willing to try anything that looks interesting.
I have experience in a wide range of areas including mobile app development with Flutter, Web AR, image composition processing with Rust, and performance tuning.
